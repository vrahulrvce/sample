# car.c

distance between two point is 400km and car average is 18km/ltr suppose the car starts at 15 ltr what can be the minimum time achieved

# solution explanation

* Fuel required = Distance / Fuel consumption
* Maximum distance = Fuel capacity * Fuel consumption
* Total fuel = Time for the first leg + Time for refueling + Time for the second leg
total fuel is approx 30 ltr at minium time of 22.22hrs
